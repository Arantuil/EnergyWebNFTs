> Preview image of the home page of the website (data is now dynamic)

### ✨To-do:
- [x] Make server that does the graphql queries and gathers data from the other 2 exchanges and combines all that data into a json file, then store that json file on firebase
- [x] Dynamic table data based on json data gathered from firebase
- [x] Find a fix for the workaround converting between the different currencies
- [x] Something to run the python script that updates the data to firebase 
- [ ] Add the 3rd NFT exchange (All orders are on-chain)
> Option 1: Unable to do it via parsing html -> need gui to add metamask and add metamask account -> need better google vm to use gui and browser

> Option 2: Unable to do it via connecting to a node -> unable to run it myself 24/7, and no 3rd party services like Infura available on EWC

### ✨Later on:
- [ ] Login system + user able to create and save their portfolio of all the NFTs they own and see the total of the floorprices combined, and percentage in price changes, maybe also in graph format
